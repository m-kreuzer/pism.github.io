##### collaborations and intercomparisons {#collaborations_and_intercomparisons}

`   * `[`the`` ``SeaRISE`` ``assessment`` ``process`](http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/SeaRISE_Assessment)` in the US plans to contribute model-based estimates of century-scale sea level changes from ice sheet and ice shelf dynamics to the IPCC AR5 report in 2013 `\
`   * `[`ice2sea`](http://www.ice2sea.eu/)` is a European effort which is somewhat comparable to SeaRISE`\
