abstract: Here, basal conditions for different years before and after
  the break-up of the tongue are inferred from surface velocity
  measurements to investigate the changes and to compare them with
  parameterizations of basal conditions commonly used in ice-sheet
  models.

  All inversions reproduce the overall pattern of observed surface
  velocities, which shows that, in general, our data and model choices
  are capable of reproducing the observations by only adjusting basal
  yield stress. In the lower 5 km of the glacier a clear trend from
  higher to lower basal yield stress values is visible.
