abstract: This paper assesses the sensitivity of projections of
  Greenland ice sheet contribution to 21st-century sea-level rise to
  the model initial state. Four initialization methods are applied
  using PISM. The simulated contribution to sea-level rise by 2100
  ranges from an equivalent of 0.2 to 6.8 cm. The largest
  uncertainties arise from different formulations of the regional
  climate models (0.8--3.9 cm) and applied scenarios (0.65--1.9 cm),
  but an important source of uncertainty is the initialization method
  (0.1--0.8 cm). These model simulations do not account for the
  recently observed acceleration of outlet glaciers and consequent
  thinning rates, ocean forcing, or the feedback occurring between
  ice-sheet elevation changes and climate forcing. These results
  should be considered a lower limit of Greenland ice sheet
  contributions to sea-level rise, until such processes have been
  integrated into large-scale ice-sheet models.
