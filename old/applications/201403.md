In this paper, effects of a new hypothesis about mountain building in
Greenland on ice sheet initiation are investigated using PISM in
combination with a climate model. According to this hypothesis,
low-relief landscapes near sea level characterized Greenland in the
Miocene. Then two phases of km-scale uplift, beginning at 10 and \~5 Ma,
respectively, initiated the formation of the present-day mountains.
These results are consistent with the observed climatic variability
superimposed on the general cooling trend in the late Cenozoic, and they
indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet of today is a relict formed under
colder conditions. The late Cenozoic mountain building in Greenland
augments the effects of the climatic deterioration leading to the
Northern Hemisphere glaciations. Without the second phase of uplift, the
Greenland Ice Sheet would have been more sensitive to the changes in
climate over the past millions of years.
