|  **Century-scale evolution of the  Jakobshavn Isbr√¶ with a high  resolution regional model**  ||

A new regional mode in PISM is applied to the Jakobshavn outlet glacier.  This mode is best suited for high spatial resolutions (< 1 km) and short timescales (< 1000 a).  The first step is the identification of a drainage basin based on the surface gradient.  Boundary conditions along the basin outline then partially-isolate the outlet glacier flow from the rest of the ice sheet.  The ice dynamics model applied within the basin is the full enthalpy-based, SSA-sliding model.   Both slow and fast ice flow are captured, as shown by a comparison to observations.
