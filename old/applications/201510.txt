The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) contribution to sea-level rise under warming scenarios has been difficult to quantify.  This paper uses 10km PISM simulations to show that if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above present then collapse of the major Antarctic ice shelves triggers a centennial- to millennial-scale response which is a long-term commitment (an unstoppable contribution) to sea-level rise.  While [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1500589|another just-published AIS PISM paper]] considered a relatively extreme climate scenario, this one finds that substantial Antarctic ice loss can be prevented only by limiting greenhouse gas emissions to RCP 2.6 levels, a specific and worrysome conclusion.  Higher-emissions scenarios lead to modeled ice loss from Antarctic that will raise sea level by 0.6â€“3 metres by the year 2300.  Greenhouse gas emissions in the next few decades strongly influence the long-term modeled contribution of the AIS.

The PISM user should note that the first paragraph of the Methods section of this paper is a compact description of a canonical application of PISM.  Later paragraphs describe more customized application, though largely through existing PISM code.  Grounding line dynamical modeling is carefully done based on the [[http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2014JoG13J093|parameterization derived from Feldmann et al (2014)]], which is part of PISM 0.6 and later.  The RCPs are used to construct surface air temperature, precipitation, and ocean temperature, with PISM PDD and three-equation models used to determine (upper) surface mass balance and sub-shelf mass balance.
