During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), glaciers in the Alps reached a
maximum extent well-beyond their current coverage (red line). This study
models the ice cap using PISM and parameterized forms of the uncertain
LGM precipitation pattern. Constraints on the model come from
geomorphological reconstruction of ice extent based on interpretation of
moraines, trimlines and erratic boulders. The model is forced using
different temperature cooling and precipitation reduction factors. Use
of the present-day precipitation pattern leads to a systematic
overestimation of the ice cover on the northern part of the Alps
relative to the southern part. A more severe decrease in precipitation
in the north was required to reproduce the LGM extent. This result
supports a southwesterly advection of atmospheric moisture to the Alps,
sustained by a southward shift of the North Atlantic storm track during
the LGM.
