\<div left 45%\> Can regional ice dynamics modeling help to understand
the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet through surface melting and
flow into outlet glaciers (calving and basal melting), and estimate the
fresh water flux into a fjord? This study considers an example, the
outlet glaciers terminating in Godthab fjord, including glacier Kangiata
Nunaata Sermia. surface mass balance and 2 m air temperature from RACMO
and HIRHAM RCM output were

\<div right 45%\> compared. The new PISM \"regional\" mode, the *pismo*
executable in *stable0.5*, was applied. The model captures the high
velocities near the terminus qualitatively, but even at high 2 km model
resolution the distinct fast flowing arms are not well modelled, and the
modelled velocities and fluxes are overall lower than than observed. The
question remains: Are there are deep troughs in the bed topography where
the surface velocity is very high?
