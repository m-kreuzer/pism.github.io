glaciations would have to be narrow to allow equatorial ice sheets**

A major goal of understanding Neoproterozoic glaciations and determining
their effect on the evolution of life and Earth\'s atmosphere is
establishing whether and how much open ocean there was during them.
Geological evidence tells us that continental ice sheets had to flow
into the ocean near the equator during these glaciations. Here we drive
the PISM ice sheet model with output from four simulations of the
ECHAM5/MPI-OM atmosphere-ocean general circulation model with
successively narrower open ocean regions. We find that extensive
equatorial ice sheets form on marine margins if sea ice extends to
within about 20 degrees latitude of the equator or less (Jormungand-like
and hard Snowball states), but do not form if there is more open ocean
than this. Given uncertainty in topographical reconstruction and ice
sheet ablation parameterizations, we perform extensive sensitivity tests
to confirm the robustness of our main conclusions.
