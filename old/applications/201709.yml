abstract: Whether a 'tipping point' will be reached in the next few
  centuries, in the dynamics of various parts of the Antarctic ice
  sheet (AIS) as it responds to a warming world, is the most difficult
  prediction question. It is an extreme challenge to models. How
  complete a model must be, so as to resolve the relevant behavior of
  the (real) dynamical system, is unknown. A negative result from
  modeling (i.e. no tipping points seen in model runs) has minimal
  value because a more-complete, or merely different, model may show a
  tipping point. Insisting that a model include all possibly-relevant
  mechanisms is unfeasible to the point of silliness.

  Tipping-point questions can be asked about the past states of the
  AIS, though using existing observations to resolve these questions
  is extraordinarily difficult. This paper uses GCM/RCM and ice-sheet
  modeling to recreate conditions of the early to mid-Pliocene when
  atmospheric CO2 concentrations were similar to present day. The
  focus of PISM application is on modeling grounding-line motion, ice
  shelf basal melt near the grounding line, and basal sliding. A novel
  method here, relative to other AIS modeling literature, is an
  autocorrelation analysis of time series for (modeled) ice mass to
  find early-warning signs of impending tipping points. A precursor to
  tipping-point-type destabilization, proximately by classic
  marine-based ice-sheet retreat, appears to be prolonged surface
  lowering in response to warm air temperatures.
