A macroscopic fracture-density ﬁeld is introduced into PISM. Its
evolution includes the initiation and growth of fractures as well as
their advection with two-dimensional ice ﬂow. To ﬁrst approximation,
fracture growth is assumed to depend on the spreading rate only, while
fracture initiation is deﬁned in terms of principal stresses. The
inferred fracture-density ﬁelds compare well with observed elongate
surface structures. The aim of this study is to introduce the ﬁeld and
investigate which of the observed surface structures can be reproduced
by the simplest physically motivated fracture source terms.
