title: When glacial giants roll over
authors: "[Anders Leverman, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact
  Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/)"
location: Antarctic ice sheet
venue: "[Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/)"

abstract: "In a short News & Views article in
  [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/), Levermann reviews the
  potential for tsunami-genic iceberg calving as a phenomenon and a
  possible hazard. PISM-PIK Antarctic ice sheet simulations gave the
  frequency distribution of iceberg height and energy in discharge
  events per decade; see box. Iceberg discharge was computed from the
  vertical extent of the ice sheet and the marginal velocity
  distribution in a present-day equilibrium state. The results show a
  peak in the abundance of icebergs with a height of around 400
  metres, and a distribution of energies up to several kilotonnes of
  TNT."
