A macroscopic fracture-density ﬁeld is introduced into PISM.  Its evolution includes the initiation and growth of fractures as well as their advection with two-dimensional ice ﬂow.  To ﬁrst approximation, fracture growth is assumed to depend on the spreading rate only, while fracture initiation is deﬁned in terms of principal stresses.  The inferred fracture-density ﬁelds compare well with observed elongate surface structures.  The aim of this study is to introduce the ﬁeld and investigate which of the observed
surface structures can be reproduced by the simplest physically motivated fracture source terms.
