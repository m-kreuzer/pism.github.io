| **Grounding-line migration in plan-view marine ice-sheet models: results of the ice2sea MISMIP3d intercomparison** ||

These are the results of a comparison between plan-view marine ice-sheet models, [[http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/|MISMIP3D]].  The major experiments use a spatially-varying perturbation in basal sliding parameters.  The goal is to model the evolution of curved grounding lines and the corresponding generating buttressing effects.  Steady-state grounding-line positions and the degree of reversibility are analyzed.  PISM results from PIK authors Albrecht and Huetten, on a 1 km grid using a hybrid-SSA formulation, show the same quality of steady state positions and reversibility as models, often specially-designed for these grounding line geometries, with more complete stress balances.
