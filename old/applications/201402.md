Continent-wide marine and terrestrial geological evidence constrains the
dynamical configuration of the Antarctic ice sheet during the last, and
possibly preceding, glacial maxima. This paper interprets results from a
remarkably high-resolution (5 km) PISM model using this evidence,
focussing on the basal thermal regime of the ice sheet, its flow
pattern, variability in subglacial erosion and sediment transport, and
how these characteristics evolve during glacial transitions. The results
show that rapid basal sliding in discrete outlets eroded and advected
sediment to the continental shelf primarily during the early stages of
advance and retreat of the ice sheet. Sector-by-sector analysis of
geologic constraints, exquisite figures showing sediment transport paths
through tight geographic confinements, and careful consideration of peak
erosion timing set a new standard for validating high-resolution
time-dependent model results with extensive geophysical evidence.
