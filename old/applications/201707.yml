abstract: "Fluid dynamics experiments are often only possible because
  theory allows rescaling a flow to fit into a laboratory. The target
  flow and its laboratory analogue must be dynamically-similar in the
  sense of dimensional analysis. Engineers study rivers and air flow
  around airframes, and we can generate laboratory models of ice flow,
  by such \"similitude\". For example, the `{{:manual.pdf|PISM User's
  Manual}}`{=mediawiki} includes a simulation of a [laboratory-scale
  radial flow of a Xanthan gum
  solution](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2012.545), one which is
  similar to a grounded ice sheet.

  This paper gives a framework for dynamical scaling of marine ice
  sheets. For the SSA dynamical model they derive scaling conditions
  between the vertical and horizontal lengths, the relevant physical
  parameters, and the response time. Timing of grounding-line changes
  is a particular focus. These relationships give parameter sets that
  leave the ice-sheet geometry unchanged, effectively rules for the
  design of numerical and laboratory experiments."
