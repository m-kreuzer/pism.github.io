abstract: During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), glaciers in the Alps
  reached a maximum extent well-beyond their current coverage (red
  line). This study models the ice cap using PISM and parameterized
  forms of the uncertain LGM precipitation pattern. Constraints on the
  model come from geomorphological reconstruction of ice extent based
  on interpretation of moraines, trimlines and erratic boulders. The
  model is forced using different temperature cooling and
  precipitation reduction factors. Use of the present-day
  precipitation pattern leads to a systematic overestimation of the
  ice cover on the northern part of the Alps relative to the southern
  part. A more severe decrease in precipitation in the north was
  required to reproduce the LGM extent. This result supports a
  southwesterly advection of atmospheric moisture to the Alps,
  sustained by a southward shift of the North Atlantic storm track
  during the LGM.
