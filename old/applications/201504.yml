abstract: The marine ice-sheet instability generally comes from the
  ocean side of the ice sheet. Using a flow-line geometry in PISM,
  this paper investigates whether instability can be triggered from
  the direction of the ice divide. The authors find that the
  instability in one basin can induce a destabilization in the other.
  The underlying mechanism is dynamic thinning and consequent motion
  of the ice divide. They conclude that for the three-dimensional
  case, the possibility of drainage basin interaction on timescales on
  the order of 1 kyr or larger cannot be excluded and needs further
  investigation.
