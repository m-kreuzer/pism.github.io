abstract: "Large uncertainties exist in the potential changes of
  dynamic ice discharge from Antarctica from precipitation. Here we
  show that snowfall and discharge are not independent, but that
  future ice discharge will increase by up to three times as a result
  of additional snowfall under global warming. Our results, based on
  PISM-PIK runs forced by climate simulations through to the end of
  2500, show that enhanced discharge exceeds the effect of surface
  warming as well as that of basal ice-shelf melting. In an ensemble
  of simulations designed to capture ice-physics uncertainty, the
  additional dynamic ice loss along the coastline compensates for
  between 30 and 65 per cent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall
  over the entire continent. This results in a dynamic ice loss of up
  to 1.25 metres in the year 2500 for the strongest warming scenario."
