{{ :applications:levermann11\_box.png?150}} In a short News & Views
article in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/), Levermann
reviews the potential for tsunami-genic iceberg calving as a phenomenon
and a possible hazard. PISM-PIK Antarctic ice sheet simulations gave the
frequency distribution of iceberg height and energy in discharge events
per decade; see box. Iceberg discharge was computed from the vertical
extent of the ice sheet and the marginal velocity distribution in a
present-day equilibrium state. The results show a peak in the abundance
of icebergs with a height of around 400 metres, and a distribution of
energies up to several kilotonnes of TNT.
