{{ :applications:levermann11_box.png?150}} In a short News & Views article in [[http://www.nature.com/nature/|Nature]], Levermann reviews the potential for tsunami-genic iceberg calving as a phenomenon and a possible hazard.  PISM-PIK Antarctic ice sheet simulations gave the frequency distribution of iceberg height and energy in discharge events per decade; see box.  Iceberg discharge was computed from the vertical extent of the ice sheet and the marginal velocity distribution in a present-day equilibrium state.  The results show a peak in the abundance of icebergs with a height of around 400 metres, and a distribution of energies up to several kilotonnes of TNT.
