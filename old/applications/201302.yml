abstract: "We interactively couple the atmosphere-ocean-vegetation
  general circulation model ECHAM5/MPIOM/LPJ with the ice sheet model
  mPISM, a modified version of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, without
  flux correction or anomaly maps in our models. We run ECHAM5 in T31
  resolution and mPISM on a 20 km grid covering most of the northern
  hemisphere. For comparison, we also perform an experiment using the
  PMIP2 protocol and the ICE-5G ice sheet reconstruction (Peltier,
  2004) instead of mPISM. In runs using pre-industrial as well as LGM
  boundary conditions, the shape of the ice sheets has a strong
  influence on the wind systems and thereby on the global climate. Our
  model shows ice sheet collapses as regular part of the ice sheet
  behavior. These pulses create strong signals in the ocean."
