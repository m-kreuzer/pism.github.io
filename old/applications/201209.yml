Inverse methods are used to estimate model parameters from observations,
here basal shear stress from the surface velocity of an ice sheet. One
starts with an initial estimate of the model parameters and then updates
them to improve the match to observations in an iterative process.
Large-scale spatial features are adjusted first. A stopping criterion
prevents the overfitting of data. In this paper, iterative inverse
methods are applied to the shallow-shelf approximation forward model. A
new incomplete Gauss--Newton method is introduced and compared to the
steepest descent and nonlinear conjugate gradient methods. Two different
stopping criteria, the discrepancy principle and a recent-improvement
threshold, are compared. The IGN method shows faster convergence than
the others. Though PISM is not mentioned by this paper, and [the
experiments were done in
python](https://github.com/damaxwell/siple), code supporting
these inversion methods is already present in the [PISM dev
branch](https://github.com/pism/pism/tree/dev).
