abstract: This poster presents outcomes of step-cooling perturbation
  from current conditions using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM).

  These simplified first experiments clearly demonstrate that ice
  sheet nucleation centers are consistent with the geological record.
  This as an encouraging start towards increased model complexity (ice
  shelves, lithospheric rebound) and transient model runs using past
  temperature and sea level reconstructions.
