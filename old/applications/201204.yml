abstract: "Polythermal conditions are ubiquitous among glaciers and
  ice sheets. Fortunately, temperature and liquid water fraction are
  functions of a single enthalpy variable: a small enthalpy change in
  cold ice is a change in temperature, while a small enthalpy change
  in temperate ice is a change in liquid water fraction. The unified
  enthalpy formulation described in this paper models the mass and
  energy balance for the three-dimensional ice fluid, for the surface
  runoff layer and for the subglacial hydrology layer, together in a
  single energy-conserving theoretical framework. It is implemented in
  PISM. Results for the Greenland ice sheet are compared with those
  from a cold-ice scheme."
