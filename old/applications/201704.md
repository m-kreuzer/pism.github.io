The temperature of an ice sheet is an important control on the
deformation of ice, but it also controls basal melt. The geothermal flux
(GHF) is a significant thermal boundary condition, and there is large
uncertainty in its magnitude and local variation. On the other hand, a
balance of heat conduction and advection\-\--the latter dominates in the
large\-\--determines the 3D temperature field within the ice. Thus a
thermomechanically-important input\-\--it is a velocity boundary
condition\-\--is the rate of surface accumulation. The 3D
conduction/advection balance determines sliding because the base is weak
where it is well-lubricated; this is dominated by basal melt in a cold
ice sheet like the Antarctic.

All of this is modeled by PISM\-\--not perfectly but it is all there.
However, understanding the sensitivity of this thermomechanical system
to it inputs, in a particular glacier, is not easy. This paper studies
the Lambert-Amery ice stream/shelf system in East Antarctica by using
observed surface velocities and ice thicknesses as the major
constraints. The authors conclude that the ice flow is most sensitive to
spatial variation in GHF near the ice divides and under the edges of the
ice streams. Their control simulation has temperate ice up to 150 m
thick, an average basal melt of 1.3 mm per year, and maximum basal
melting of about 0.5 m per year.
