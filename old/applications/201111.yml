abstract: A study of the extent of the Greenland ice sheet during the
  Mid-Pliocene Warmth (3.3--3.0 Ma), its advance across the
  continental shelf during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene
  glaciations (3.0--2.4 Ma) as implied by offshore geological studies,
  and the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions around
  2.4 Ma as deduced from the deposits of the Kap KÃ¸benhavn Formation,
  North Greenland.
