The build-up of the Greenland Ice Sheet from ice-free conditions is studied using PISM
driven by fields from an atmospheric GCM.  Experiments where the two are
coupled off-line are augmented by one where an intermediate
ice sheet configuration is coupled back to the GCM.  The ice sheet regrows from the ice-free state but this is halted when the intermediate recoupling step is included. This inhibition of
further growth is due to a FÃ¶hn effect of moist air parcels being
lifted over the intermediate ice sheet and arriving in the
low-lying Greenland interior with high temperatures. This
demonstrates that two-way coupling between the atmosphere
and the ice sheet is essential for understanding its dynamics.
Conditions cooler than those of today may
be necessary for the GrIS to regrow to the present volume.
