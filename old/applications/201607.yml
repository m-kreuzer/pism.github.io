abstract: This paper uses PISM, calibrated against field-based
  evidence, to reconstruct the Cordilleran ice sheet's history through
  the last glacial cycle. Until now, geological studies of this major
  North American ice sheet have lacked ice-sheet-wide spatial
  reconstructions.

  Simulations are driven by time-dependent temperature offsets from
  six proxy records located around the globe. Although model response
  to evolving climate forcing is variable, all simulations produce two
  major glaciations during marine oxygen isotope stages 4 (62.2--56.9
  ka) and 2 (23.2--16.9 ka). The timing of glaciation is better
  reproduced using temperature reconstructions from Greenland and
  Antarctic ice cores than from regional oceanic sediment cores.
  During most of the cycle the modelled ice cover is discontinuous and
  restricted to high mountain areas. However, a central ice dome in
  the Skeena Mountains persists throughout, and it hosts the last
  remains of Cordilleran ice into the middle Holocene (6.7 ka).
