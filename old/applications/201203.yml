abstract: "A new regional mode in PISM is applied to the Jakobshavn
  outlet glacier. This mode is best suited for high spatial
  resolutions (< 1 km) and short timescales (< 1000 a). The first step
  is the identification of a drainage basin based on the surface
  gradient. Boundary conditions along the basin outline then
  partially-isolate the outlet glacier flow from the rest of the ice
  sheet. The ice dynamics model applied within the basin is the full
  enthalpy-based, SSA-sliding model. Both slow and fast ice flow are
  captured, as shown by a comparison to observations."
