Validation and assessment of model performance is critical, but it is
notoriously-challenging in ice sheet modeling. This paper couples PISM
to the [HIRHAM5 regional climate
model](http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/tr06-17.pdf) for simulations of
the Greenland ice sheet. The results are compared to observations in the
1989-2011 period (hindcasting), in which ice geometry, ice surface
velocity, gravitationally-derived mass time-series, and surface
elevation change observations are all available. The simulations
reproduce the seasonal signal and decadal trends in mass loss but they
show deficiencies compared to observed changes in ice discharge. The
paper concludes that it is important to use //multiple// data sets for
model validation, and it identifies rates of change of spatially-dense
observations as preferred validation metrics.
