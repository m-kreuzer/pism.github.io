abstract: "Reconstructions of the time-dependent geometry of ice
  sheets over the last ice-age cycle (100kyr) can draw from two
  categories of data. On one hand there are constraints from
  observations of GIA (glacial isostatic adjustment) and of eustatic
  sea-level through marine sediment stratigraphy. These are
  constraints on ice geometry but via temporal and/or spatial
  integration. On the other hand there is high temporal resolution,
  but geographically local, information in ice cores about climate
  over the same period. The former category informs the output (ice
  thickness and grounding line) of the ice sheet evolution equations
  while the later inform the input (source term).

  Like [Stuhne & Peltier (2015)](applications:201512), this paper
  connects the two categories using PISM. Because
  climate-record-driven applications of PISM, such as [the SeaRISE
  project](applications:201303), already use well-posed simulations, a
  reconciliation of the two data categories is necessarily a
  temporal/spatial inversion. Here the goal is close fit to the
  GIA+eustatic-record-based ICE-6G_C ice thickness reconstruction
  from tuned (\"nudged\") climate-input-driven PISM runs. These
  authors analyze the amount of surface mass balance correction,
  applied using hypothesized characteristic time scales, needed to
  reduce the error between PISM output and ICE-6G_C. An example of
  the usefulness of this methodology is in diagnosing the origin of
  Meltwater Pulse 1B (-11kyr). They suggest it is more likely to have
  been in North America than in Antarctica, its origin in the
  ICE-6G_C reconstruction."
