Does the presence of ice streams enhance deglaciation? If so, this
should render certain large ice sheets, those with geometry and basal
properties conducive to stream formation, more sensitive to changes in
the climatic mass balance input. Based on an idealized PISM
configuration, the simulations in this study show that when the ice
sheet is large and ice streams are sufficiently developed an upward
shift in equilibrium line altitude results in rapid deglaciation, while
the same shift applied to an ice sheet without fully-formed ice streams
results in continued ice sheet growth or slower deglaciation. Rapid
deglaciation in ice sheets with significant streaming behavior is caused
by ice stream acceleration and the attendant enhancement of calving and
surface melting at low elevations. Ice stream acceleration is ultimately
the result of steepening of the ice surface and increased driving
stresses in ice stream onset zones, which come about due to the
dependence of surface mass balance on elevation.
