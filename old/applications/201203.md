A new regional mode in PISM is applied to the Jakobshavn outlet glacier.
This mode is best suited for high spatial resolutions (\< 1 km) and
short timescales (\< 1000 a). The first step is the identification of a
drainage basin based on the surface gradient. Boundary conditions along
the basin outline then partially-isolate the outlet glacier flow from
the rest of the ice sheet. The ice dynamics model applied within the
basin is the full enthalpy-based, SSA-sliding model. Both slow and fast
ice flow are captured, as shown by a comparison to observations.
