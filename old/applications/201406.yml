abstract: "Floating ice shelves, fringing most of Antarctica, exert
  restraining forces on the ice flow. Though abrupt ice--shelf retreat
  has been observed, it is generally considered a localized
  phenomenon. This paper shows, by using [PISM-PIK](pik:pism-pik),
  that the disintegration of an ice shelf may induce the spontaneous
  retreat of its neighbor. The spontaneous but gradual retreat of the
  Larsen B ice front, as observed after the disintegration of the
  adjacent Larsen A ice shelf, is reproduced. The \"A\" collapse yields
  a change in spreading rate in \"B\", via their connecting ice
  channels, and thereby causes a retreat of the ice front to its
  observed position of the year 2000. This reproduces the
  configuration of \"B\" prior to its collapse in 2002.

  For the PISM user this paper illustrates what modeling becomes
  possible with the combined PIK mechanisms for ice shelf front
  modeling, including sub-grid mass conservation and \"eigencalving\";
  see the references of the paper and Chapter 8 of the PISM User's
  Manual."
