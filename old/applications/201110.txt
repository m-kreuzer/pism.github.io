This poster presents outcomes of step-cooling perturbation from current conditions using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM).

These simplified first experiments clearly demonstrate that ice sheet nucleation centers are consistent with the geological record.  This as an encouraging start towards increased model complexity (ice shelves, lithospheric rebound) and transient model runs using past temperature and sea level reconstructions.
