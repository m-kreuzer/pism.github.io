abstract: In this paper, authors discuss their work in evaluating and
  increasing the I/O performance of PISM on a state-of-the-art
  supercomputer by using a 1 km Greenland ice sheet setup. In
  particular, they found that the computation performed by PISM is
  highly scalable, but that the I/O demands of the higher-resolution
  model are a significant drag on overall performance. The paper
  describes a series of experiments to find the cause of the
  relatively-poor I/O performance and how such performance could be
  improved. By making simple changes to the PISM source code and one
  of the I/O libraries used by PISM authors were able to provide an
  8-fold increase in I/O performance.
