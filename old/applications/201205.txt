Observed large-scale disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves has moved their fronts closer towards grounded ice, accelerating ice-sheet discharge and contributing to global sea-level rise.  Here we describe the first-order large-scale kinematic contribution to calving which is consistent with large-scale observation.   This calving law depends only on local ice properties which are, however, determined by the full topography of the ice shelf.  Simulations in PISM-PIK using the parameterization reproduces multiple stable fronts as observed for the Larsen A and B Ice Shelves, including abrupt transitions between them.  We also Ô¨Ånd multiple stable states of the Ross Ice Shelf.
