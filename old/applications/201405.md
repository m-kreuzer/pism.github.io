By using MISMIP3d simulations across a range of resolutions, this paper
shows that the SIA+SSA hybrid stress balance in PISM can model grounding
line motion in a perturbed ice-sheet--shelf system. The key
improvements, all included in pism0.6, are: linear interpolation of the
grounding line, locally-interpolated basal friction, and an improved
driving-stress computation across the grounding line. The reversibility
of the grounding line, after a local perturbation of basal resistance
comes and goes, is captured by the model even at medium and low
horizontal resolutions (\> 10 km). The transient model response is
qualitatively-similar to that of higher-order models, though with higher
sensitivity to perturbations on very short timescales. Our findings
support the application of PISM to the Antarctic ice sheet from regional
up to continental scales and even at relatively-low spatial resolutions.
