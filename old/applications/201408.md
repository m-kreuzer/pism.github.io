We use a Tikhonov inverse method, with PISM\'s SSA as a forward model,
to invert for basal conditions from surface velocity data throughout a
well-observed period (1985, 2000, 2005, 2006 and 2008) of rapid change.
Ice-softness, model norm, and regularization parameter choices are
justified using the data-model misfit metric and the L-curve method. The
sensitivity of the inversion results to these parameter choices is
explored. We find a lowering of effective basal yield stress in the
first 7 km upstream from the 2008 grounding line and no significant
changes higher upstream. The temporal evolution in the fast flow area is
in broad agreement with a Mohr--Coulomb parameterization of basal shear
stress, but with a till friction angle much lower than has been measured
for till samples. The lowering of effective basal yield stress is
significant within the uncertainties of the inversion, but it cannot be
ruled out that there are other significant contributors to the
acceleration of the glacier.
