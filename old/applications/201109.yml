abstract: "This paper presents a dynamic equilibrium simulation of the
  ice sheet-shelf system on Antarctica with the Potsdam Parallel Ice
  Sheet Model (PISM-PIK) with a focus on the Ronne-Filchner and Ross
  ice shelf areas as well as on the whole ice-sheet system.

  PISM-PIK (and now [PISM](news:piikmerge)) allows free movement of
  grounding lines and calving fronts thanks to a physically-motivated
  calving law based on horizontal spreading rates and an
  implementation of a calving-front stress boundary condition.

  The results support the approach of superposition of SIA and SSA for
  the representation of fast motion of grounded ice."
