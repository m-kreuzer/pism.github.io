abstract: "Can regional ice dynamics modeling help to understand the
  mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet through surface melting and
  flow into outlet glaciers (calving and basal melting), and estimate
  the fresh water flux into a fjord? This study considers an example,
  the outlet glaciers terminating in Godthab fjord, including glacier
  Kangiata Nunaata Sermia. surface mass balance and 2 m air
  temperature from RACMO and HIRHAM RCM output were compared. The new
  PISM 'regional' mode, the *pismo* executable in *stable0.5*, was
  applied. The model captures the high velocities near the terminus
  qualitatively, but even at high 2 km model resolution the distinct
  fast flowing arms are not well modelled, and the modelled velocities
  and fluxes are overall lower than than observed. The question
  remains: Are there are deep troughs in the bed topography where the
  surface velocity is very high?
