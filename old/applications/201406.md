Floating ice shelves, fringing most of Antarctica, exert restraining
forces on the ice flow. Though abrupt ice--shelf retreat has been
observed, it is generally considered a localized phenomenon. This paper
shows, by using [PISM-PIK](pik:pism-pik), that the
disintegration of an ice shelf may induce the spontaneous retreat of its
neighbor. The spontaneous but gradual retreat of the Larsen B ice front,
as observed after the disintegration of the adjacent Larsen A ice shelf,
is reproduced. The \"A\" collapse yields a change in spreading rate in
\"B\", via their connecting ice channels, and thereby causes a retreat
of the ice front to its observed position of the year 2000. This
reproduces the configuration of \"B\" prior to its collapse in 2002.

For the PISM user this paper illustrates what modeling becomes possible
with the combined PIK mechanisms for ice shelf front modeling, including
sub-grid mass conservation and \"eigencalving\"; see the references of
the paper and Chapter 8 of the PISM User\'s Manual.
