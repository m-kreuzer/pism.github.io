\<div left 45%\> Here, basal conditions for different years before and
after the break-up of the tongue are inferred from surface velocity
measurements to investigate the changes and to compare them with
parameterizations of basal conditions commonly used in ice-sheet models.

\<div right 45%\> All inversions reproduce the overall pattern of
observed surface velocities, which shows that, in general, our data and
model choices are capable of reproducing the observations by only
adjusting basal yield stress. In the lower 5 km of the glacier a clear
trend from higher to lower basal yield stress values is visible.
