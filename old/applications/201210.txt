Linear response functions can separately estimate the sea-level contributions of thermal expansion and solid ice discharge from Greenland and Antarctica.  This formalism introduces a time-dependence which allows for future rates of sea-level rise to be influenced by past climate variations.  The linear response function for the solid ice discharge is computed with the Potsdam Parallel Ice Sheet Model PISM-PIK (Winkelmann et al. 2011) under surface warming scenarios.  Different from earlier studies we conclude that solid ice discharge from Greenland due to dynamic thinning is bounded by 0.42 m sea-level equivalent.  Ice discharge induced by surface warming on Antarctica is best captured by a model which
reflects the fact that ice loss increases with the cumulative amount of heat available for softening the ice in our model.
