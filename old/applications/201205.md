Observed large-scale disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves has moved
their fronts closer towards grounded ice, accelerating ice-sheet
discharge and contributing to global sea-level rise. Here we describe
the first-order large-scale kinematic contribution to calving which is
consistent with large-scale observation. This calving law depends only
on local ice properties which are, however, determined by the full
topography of the ice shelf. Simulations in PISM-PIK using the
parameterization reproduces multiple stable fronts as observed for the
Larsen A and B Ice Shelves, including abrupt transitions between them.
We also Ô¨Ånd multiple stable states of the Ross Ice Shelf.
