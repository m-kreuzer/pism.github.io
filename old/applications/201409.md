This paper uses PISM to define an \"ice-plug\" which, if removed from
the coastal ice in the Wilkes Basin of East Antarctica, would initiate
irreversible retreat of the grounded ice in that basin. The modeled
retreats, which occur on a time scale of a few thousand years, generate
3\--4 m of sea level rise from the region surrounding the basin. Thus
this basin is a potential \"tipping-point\" ice sheet configuration, in
additional to the better-known West Antarctica configurations. For the
PISM user this paper shows its ability to model an ice sheet region
(hashed in figure) at high resolution across a range of ice dynamics
parameters and climate forcing choices.
