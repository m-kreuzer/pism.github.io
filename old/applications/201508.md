The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) will likely experience higher snow
accumulation rates in a warmer climate because warmer air has a higher
moisture-holding capacity. This paper quantifies the effect based on
ice-core data and paleo-climate simulations, which together show a
consistent continental-scale accumulation increase of 5 percent per
degree Kelvin. (Note ice-core data and GCM-type modelling results agree
for the last deglaciation.) However, some of the mass gain of the AIS is
offset by dynamical losses induced by accumulation. This is where PISM
plays a supporting role in the paper. PISM results were used to generate
a response function allowing projections of sea-level fall in terms of
continental-scale accumulation changes. In PISM the accumulation changes
can and do compete with changes in surface melting and with dynamical
losses induced by mechanisms like ocean interaction and sliding.
