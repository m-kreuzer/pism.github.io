We interactively couple the atmosphere-ocean-vegetation general
circulation model ECHAM5/MPIOM/LPJ with the ice sheet model mPISM, a
modified version of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, without flux
correction or anomaly maps in our models. We run ECHAM5 in T31
resolution and mPISM on a 20 km grid covering most of the northern
hemisphere. For comparison, we also perform an experiment using the
PMIP2 protocol and the ICE-5G ice sheet reconstruction (Peltier, 2004)
instead of mPISM. In runs using pre-industrial as well as LGM boundary
conditions, the shape of the ice sheets has a strong influence on the
wind systems and thereby on the global climate. Our model shows ice
sheet collapses as regular part of the ice sheet behavior. These pulses
create strong signals in the ocean.
