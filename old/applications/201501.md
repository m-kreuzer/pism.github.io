Modeling Northern Hemisphere glacial conditions using general
circulation models (GCMs) in quasi-equilibrium with prescribed ice
sheets can lead to inconsistencies between the modeled climate and ice
sheets. To avoid this problem, this paper models the ice sheets
explicitly, giving the first results from coupled ice sheet--climate
simulations for pre-industrial times and the Last Glacial Maximum.

They use the atmosphere--ocean--vegetation GCM ECHAM5/MPIOM/LPJ
bidirectionally-coupled with a modified version of PISM 0.3 on a 20 km
grid covering the Northern Hemisphere. The model system adequately
represents large, non-linear climate perturbations, and the results
agree reasonably well with reconstructions and observations. A large
part of the drainage of the ice sheets occurs in ice streams which show
recurring surges as internal oscillations. The Hudson Strait Ice Stream
surges with an ice volume equivalent to about 5 m sea level and a
recurrence interval of about 7000 yr, in agreement with basic
expectations for Heinrich events.
