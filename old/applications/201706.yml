abstract: "Glacial erratic boulders in the Rhone Valley north of the
  Alps, which have intrigued scientists for two centuries, have
  characteristic lithologies which can be matched to source regions in
  the mountains. This study uses their locations, plus the maximum
  extent of the ice sheet (e.g. moraine mapping), to constrain a PISM
  model ([Becker et al 2016](http://www.geogr-helv.net/71/173/2016/))
  of the ice flow around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM,
  ~24ka b.p.). The 1 km grid, physically-comprehensive model, which
  includes membrane-stress-balanced sliding, polythermal
  thermodynamics, and earth deformation, generates the evolving ice
  geometry and velocity fields. The boulders are modeled as tracers
  within the time-dependent flow.

  The dominant flow fields in the Valley, including the distinctive
  erratics signature of the northeastern Solothurn ice sheet lobe,
  turn out to be insensitive to sliding parameters and bed elevation
  in the model. Instead, the authors are able to infer the
  paleo-climatic conditions responsible for the transport routes of
  the erratics. They show that only one tested precipitation pattern
  allows boulders to be (correctly) diverted into the Solothurn lobe
  during the LGM. This precipitation pattern supports, but suggests
  additional detail in, an existing theory of preferential moisture
  advection during the LGM.

  A spectacular video of a full simulation of the ice sheet, over the
  entire 120ka ice age cycle, [is at co-author J. Seguinot's
