Large uncertainties exist in the potential changes of dynamic ice
discharge from Antarctica from precipitation. Here we show that snowfall
and discharge are not independent, but that future ice discharge will
increase by up to three times as a result of additional snowfall under
global warming. Our results, based on PISM-PIK runs forced by climate
simulations through to the end of 2500, show that enhanced discharge
exceeds the effect of surface warming as well as that of basal ice-shelf
melting. In an ensemble of simulations designed to capture ice-physics
uncertainty, the additional dynamic ice loss along the coastline
compensates for between 30 and 65 per cent of the ice gain due to
enhanced snowfall over the entire continent. This results in a dynamic
ice loss of up to 1.25 metres in the year 2500 for the strongest warming
scenario.
