Polythermal conditions are ubiquitous among glaciers and ice sheets.
Fortunately, temperature and liquid water fraction are functions of a
single enthalpy variable: a small enthalpy change in cold ice is a
change in temperature, while a small enthalpy change in temperate ice is
a change in liquid water fraction. The unified enthalpy formulation
described in this paper models the mass and energy balance for the
three-dimensional ice fluid, for the surface runoff layer and for the
subglacial hydrology layer, together in a single energy-conserving
theoretical framework. It is implemented in PISM. Results for the
Greenland ice sheet are compared with those from a cold-ice scheme.
