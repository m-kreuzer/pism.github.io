abstract: "Two versions of PISM were among the ten ice sheet models
  used to study sensitivity of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
  to prescribed changes of surface mass balance, sub-ice-shelf melting
  and basal sliding. Results exhibit a large range in projected
  contributions to sea level change. In most cases, the
  sea-level-relevant ice volume lost is linearly dependent on the
  strength of the forcing. Combinations of forcings can be closely
  approximated by linearly summing the contributions from single
  forcing experiments suggesting that non-linear feedbacks are modest.

  Our models indicate that Greenland is more sensitive than Antarctica
  to likely atmospheric changes in temperature and precipitation,
  while Antarctica is most sensitive to increased ice-shelf basal
  melting. An experiment approximating the IPCC's RCP8.5 scenario
  produces first century contributions to sea level of 22.3 and 8.1 cm
  from Greenland and Antarctica, respectively, with a range among
  models of 62 and 14 cm, respectively. By 200 years, projections
  increase to 53.2 and 26.7 cm, respectively, with ranges of 79 and 43
  cm."
