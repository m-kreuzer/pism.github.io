abstract: "This second paper explores Greenland climate scenarios and
  forcing experiments from the 31 member [Sea-level Response to Ice
  Sheet Evolution
  (SeaRISE)](http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/SeaRISE_Assessment)
  project. Although the modeled responses are not always homogeneous,
  consistent spatial trends emerge from the ensemble analysis,
  indicating distinct vulnerabilities of the Greenland ice sheet.
  There are clear response patterns associated with each forcing (1. a
  change in oceanic condition, 2. a warmer atmospheric environment,
  and 3. enhanced basal lubrication). Similar mass loss at the whole
  ice sheet scale will result in different mass losses at the regional
  scale. All forcings lead to an increased mass loss for the coming
  centuries, with increased basal lubrication and warmer ocean
  conditions affecting mainly outlet glaciers, while the impacts of
  atmospheric forcings affect the whole ice sheet.

  sheet](applications:201309)."
