An ensemble of numerical simulations of the Cordilleran ice sheet in
western North America during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using the
Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Temperature offsets to the present-day
climatologies are applied from five different data sets. Surface mass
balance is computed from precipitation and temperature using a positive
degree-day model. We assess the model against a geomorphological
reconstruction of the ice margin at the LGM. Modelled ice sheet outlines
and volumes appear highly sensitive to the choice of climate forcing.
For three of the four reanalysis data sets used, differences in
precipitation are the major source for discrepancies between model
results. Part of the mismatch is due to unresolved orographic
precipitation effects caused by the coarse resolution of reanalysis
data.
