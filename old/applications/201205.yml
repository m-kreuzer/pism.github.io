abstract: "Observed large-scale disintegration of Antarctic ice
  shelves has moved their fronts closer towards grounded ice,
  accelerating ice-sheet discharge and contributing to global
  sea-level rise. Here we describe the first-order large-scale
  kinematic contribution to calving which is consistent with
  large-scale observation. This calving law depends only on local ice
  properties which are, however, determined by the full topography of
  the ice shelf. Simulations in PISM-PIK using the parameterization
  reproduces multiple stable fronts as observed for the Larsen A and B
  Ice Shelves, including abrupt transitions between them. We also find
  multiple stable states of the Ross Ice Shelf."
