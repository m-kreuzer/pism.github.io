The build-up of the Greenland Ice Sheet from ice-free conditions is
studied using PISM driven by fields from an atmospheric GCM. Experiments
where the two are coupled off-line are augmented by one where an
intermediate ice sheet configuration is coupled back to the GCM. The ice
sheet regrows from the ice-free state but this is halted when the
intermediate recoupling step is included. This inhibition of further
growth is due to a FÃ¶hn effect of moist air parcels being lifted over
the intermediate ice sheet and arriving in the low-lying Greenland
interior with high temperatures. This demonstrates that two-way coupling
between the atmosphere and the ice sheet is essential for understanding
its dynamics. Conditions cooler than those of today may be necessary for
the GrIS to regrow to the present volume.
