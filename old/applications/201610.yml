abstract: Depth of water on the Antarctic continental shelf is one key
  factor determining the maximum possible contribution of ice shelf
  processes (calving and sub-shelf melting/freezing) to ice-sheet mass
  balance. This paper uses PISM to investigate how shelf-depth changes
  through geologic time might have affected Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS)
  dynamics. Over-deepened, shallow, and intermediate versions of
  BEDMAP2 bathymetry were combined with unmodified land elevations.
  For climate forcing similiar to the last glacial cycle, a polar AIS
  surrounded by shallow and intermediate bathymetries experiences
  rapid grounding-line advance early during the transition from
  interglacial to glacial conditions. The corresponding increase in
  mass is primarily a result of lower calving fluxes from smaller-area
  ice shelves. In contrast, the currently over-deepened bathymetry in
  the same forcing generates the expected gradual advance of grounding
  lines.
