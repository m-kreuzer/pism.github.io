abstract: A macroscopic fracture-density field is introduced into PISM.
  Its evolution includes the initiation and growth of fractures as
  well as their advection with two-dimensional ice flow. To first
  approximation, fracture growth is assumed to depend on the spreading
  rate only, while fracture initiation is defined in terms of principal
  stresses. The inferred fracture-density fields compare well with
  observed elongate surface structures. The aim of this study is to
  introduce the field and investigate which of the observed surface
  structures can be reproduced by the simplest physically motivated
  fracture source terms.
