This paper might best be understood as the second of three studies, by
these authors, of three Antarctic ice sheet/shelf basins. These basins
are among the biggest and, before studying their properties in detail,
the most potentially unstable. But the PISM model results //do not//
suggest all of these basins act the same.

The first of these papers, [M. Mengel and A. Levermann (2014) \"Ice plug
prevents irreversible discharge from East
Antarctica\"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2226),
suggests that the Wilkes basin is likely to destabilize under sufficient
forcing to remove a certain (quantified) amount of near-ocean ice, but
that the time scale of destabilization is long. The third of these
papers, [J. Feldmann and A. Levermann (2015) \"Collapse of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet after local destabilization of the Amundsen
Basin\"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1512482112), which
[just appeared in November
2015](news:nostoppingafteramundsen_1115), demonstrates the
fast, and very large in magnitude, destabilization of the whole of WAIS
from an Amundsen Sea basin forcing. The current paper suggests that, by
contrast, the Filchner-Ronne basin is essentially stable in the sense
that the forcing dominates its response.

Ocean models do indicate an abrupt intrusion of warm circumpolar deep
water into the cavity below the Filchner--Ronne ice shelf within the
next two centuries. The basin\'s retrograde bed slope would allow for an
unstable ice-sheet retreat, but the buttressing of the large ice shelf
and the narrow glacier troughs tend to inhibit such instability. This
paper\'s main result, as shown in the graph at left, is that buttressing
\"wins\". Stronger forcing (\"shelf melting\") generates greater ice
loss, but there is no tipping point as with the other basins. The
response is roughly linear.
