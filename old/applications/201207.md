We use output from a general circulation model (CAM3+CLM) to construct
adaptive temperature and precipitation patterns to force PISM off-line,
taking into consideration that the patterns change in a non-uniform way,
both spatially and temporally, as the geometry of the ice sheet evolves
and as climate changes. In a series of experiments we investigate
retreat from the present day configuration and build-up from ice free
conditions during a warmer-than-present climate. We find that the ice
sheet is able to survive and build up at higher temperatures using the
more realistic adaptive patterns compared to the classic constant
patterns. The ice sheet is multistable at least for certain temperature
forcings, so it does not necessarily return to its initial configuration
after a temperature excursion.
