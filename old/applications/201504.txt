The marine ice-sheet instability generally comes from the ocean side of the ice sheet.  Using a flow-line geometry in PISM, this paper investigates whether instability can be triggered from the direction of the ice divide.  The authors find that the instability in one basin can induce a destabilization in the other.  The underlying mechanism is dynamic thinning and consequent motion of the ice divide.  They conclude that for the three-dimensional case, the possibility of drainage basin interaction on timescales on the order of 1 kyr or larger cannot be excluded and needs further investigation.
