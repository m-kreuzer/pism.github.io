abstract: This paper uses PISM to define an 'ice-plug' which, if
  removed from the coastal ice in the Wilkes Basin of East Antarctica,
  would initiate irreversible retreat of the grounded ice in that
  basin. The modeled retreats, which occur on a time scale of a few
  thousand years, generate 3--4 m of sea level rise from the region
  surrounding the basin. Thus this basin is a potential
  'tipping-point' ice sheet configuration, in additional to the
  better-known West Antarctica configurations. For the PISM user this
  paper shows its ability to model an ice sheet region (hashed in
  figure) at high resolution across a range of ice dynamics parameters
  and climate forcing choices.
