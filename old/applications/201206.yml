abstract: Numerical experiments are conducted on a synthetic
  topography with PISM, in which stress balance is connected to
  evolving thermodynamics and hydrology. The sensitivity of cyclic
  behaviour to changes in sliding-law parameters and the climate input
  is studied. Multiple types of oscillations were found, with strong
  variations in both amplitude and frequency. High-frequency
  oscillations (period 114--169 years), which are shown to have a
  major impact on ice velocities and a small effect on the ice volume,
  are related to variations in the water distribution at the base.
  Low-frequency cycles (period 1000+ years), which have a major impact
  on both velocities and ice volume, are linked to changes in the
  thermal regime.
