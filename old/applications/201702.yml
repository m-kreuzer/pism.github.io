abstract: Does the presence of ice streams enhance deglaciation? If
  so, this should render certain large ice sheets, those with geometry
  and basal properties conducive to stream formation, more sensitive
  to changes in the climatic mass balance input. Based on an idealized
  PISM configuration, the simulations in this study show that when the
  ice sheet is large and ice streams are sufficiently developed an
  upward shift in equilibrium line altitude results in rapid
  deglaciation, while the same shift applied to an ice sheet without
  fully-formed ice streams results in continued ice sheet growth or
  slower deglaciation. Rapid deglaciation in ice sheets with
  significant streaming behavior is caused by ice stream acceleration
  and the attendant enhancement of calving and surface melting at low
  elevations. Ice stream acceleration is ultimately the result of
  steepening of the ice surface and increased driving stresses in ice
  stream onset zones, which come about due to the dependence of
  surface mass balance on elevation.
