abstract: ICE-6G_C ice thickness histories come from present-day
  uplift rates, exposure-age and radiocarbon dating, the theory of
  glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), and a self-consistent theory of
  sea level. Such reconstructions are independent of ice dynamical
  approximations. This paper asks whether ICE-6G_C histories for the
  Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are compatible with ice dynamics
  as represented by PISM models. They infer compatibility when
  uncertainties in mass balance history are taken fully into account.
  Uncertainties in atmospheric and sub-shelf mass balance since the
  Eemian (-122ka)---here represented by the SeaRISE paleo-modeling
  choices, along with simplifications in the PISM ice dynamics model,
  are carefully considered in a time-dependent inverse-modeling
  framework. Modeled Holocene shoreline evidence for relative sea
  level changes, present-day ice velocities, and present-day uplift
  rates (figure at left), are used to assess the agreement. The
  magnitudes of the mass balance modifications needed to "nudge" the
  thicknesses toward ICE-6G_C values, with several relaxation
  timescales considered, are evaluated as a measure of misfit between
  the reconstruction and the ice dynamical simulation.
