Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland\'s fastest-flowing outlet glacier, lost its
floating tongue in 1995, an event which is often attributed to changes
in ocean temperature. This

show the results of PISM simulations of this event, based on a step
increase from 180 m/yr to 225 m/yr in sub-shelf melt rate during 1995
(Motyka et al. 2011). The simulations are started from
reasonably-detailed observations of the 1985 state of the outlet
glacier. A high-resolution HIRHAM5 reanalysis (Langen et al. 2015) is
used for the atmospheric 1989\--2011 climate. The results show that
general patterns are simulated correctly, with ice speeds which almost
double after break-up of the floating tongue. The timing of the break-up
is too early and too fast, but these simulations do not include the
\"ice rumple\" (Echelmeyer et al. 1991), which may add stability to the
floating tongue.
