This second paper explores Greenland climate scenarios and forcing experiments from the 31 member [[http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/SeaRISE_Assessment|Sea-level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution (SeaRISE)]] project.  Although the
modeled responses are not always homogeneous, consistent spatial trends emerge from the
ensemble analysis, indicating distinct vulnerabilities of the Greenland ice sheet. There are
clear response patterns associated with each forcing (1. a change in oceanic condition, 2. a warmer atmospheric environment, and 3. enhanced basal lubrication).  Similar mass loss at the whole ice sheet scale will result in different mass losses at the regional scale.  All forcings lead to an increased mass loss for the
coming centuries, with increased basal lubrication and warmer ocean conditions affecting
mainly outlet glaciers, while the impacts of atmospheric forcings affect the whole ice sheet.
