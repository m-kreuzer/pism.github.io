abstract: "These are the results of a comparison between plan-view
  marine ice-sheet models,
  [MISMIP3D](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/). The major
  experiments use a spatially-varying perturbation in basal sliding
  parameters. The goal is to model the evolution of curved grounding
  lines and the corresponding generating buttressing effects.
  Steady-state grounding-line positions and the degree of
  reversibility are analyzed. PISM results from PIK authors Albrecht
  and Huetten, on a 1 km grid using a hybrid-SSA formulation, show the
  same quality of steady state positions and reversibility as models,
  often specially-designed for these grounding line geometries, with
  more complete stress balances."
