This paper uses PISM to investigate how the last glacial maximum
Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet might have modified its bed both at
maximum extent and during progressive grounding line retreat. The work
exploits high-resolution whole-Antarctic modelling by the same author
([Golledge et al 2013](:publications#section2013), [Golledge
et al 2014](:publications#section2014)). PISM results are
post-processed to compute an erosion potential which is proportional to
the product of modeled basal shear stress and sliding velocity. The
results show that peak subglacial erosion rates are preferentially
located in areas of convergent flow and where horizontal strain rates
are highest, leading to deepening of subglacial basins in such
locations. Because the ice sheet selectively erodes its bed beneath
outlets, over successive glacial cycles erosional deepening may
accelerate the retreat of the ice sheet margin during periods of rising
sea level.
