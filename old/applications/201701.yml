abstract: "Little is known about the dynamical system formed when a
  marine-based ice sheet interacts with the global ocean/atmosphere
  circulation. While some understanding of this dynamical system can
  come from coupling ice sheet models to earth system models, this
  needs validation from observations on the relevant timescales of the
  coupled system. These timescales are likely to be multi-century,
  millennial, and longer.

  This paper describes coupled simulations using a PISM-modeled
  Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) with incomplete coupling to the global
  circulation. On the one hand, the AIS model is forced by Southern
  Ocean temperatures from the [LOVECLIM Earth System
  model](http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/3/603/2010/gmd-3-603-2010.html),
  while on the other the modeled AIS meltwater is used to force the
  [UVic global climate model](http://climate.uvic.ca/model/). The
  model results are compared to high-temporal-resolution records of
  iceberg-rafted debris for the last 8000 years from two sites in the
  Scotia Sea, which provide a spatially-integrated signal of ice sheet
  variability in the Holocene. The model and data share variability at
  centennial and millennial frequencies. The primary conclusion is
  that fluctuations in AIS discharge caused by relatively-small
  changes in subsurface ocean temperature can amplify multi-centennial
  climate variability regionally and globally. A dynamic AIS may have
  driven climate fluctuations during the Holocene."
