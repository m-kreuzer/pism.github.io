When thermodynamics are coupled to basal sliding through the production
of liquid water in a modeled basal till layer, PISM may exhibit cyclic,
surge-like behavior. This paper studies such ice-discharge instabilities
in PISM for a buttressed ice-sheet-stream-shelf system. When present the
simulated surge cycles, which are believed to be fundamentally physical,
have 1000 to 5000 year periods in the studied parameter ranges. This
work extends prior work on cyclic PISM behavior ([Bueler & Brown
2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JF001179), [van Pelt &
Oerlemans 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2012JoG11J217)) to
marine ice sheet conditions, but the 1 km resolution model here is
significantly more complete than in those studies. It includes
*stable0.7* version implementations of enthalpy-based thermodynamics, an
improved till-layer hydrology model ([Bueler & van Pelt
2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1613-2015)), a sub-grid
scheme at the grounding line ([Feldman et al
2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2014JoG13J093)), and a
buttressed ice shelf. The surface conditions are all constant,
independent even of surface elevation, so the cyclic behavior arises
purely internally in the ice and the basal layer. This paper includes a
new and careful analysis of cyclic behavior, identifying three competing
time-scales controlling such cycles. Results suggest that ice sheets of
medium thickness may be more susceptible to surging than thin or thick
ones. The mechanisms studied here may play a role in Heinrich events of
the late-LGM Laurentide Ice Sheet and/or in ice-stream shutdown and
reactivation observed in West Antarctica. This is the definitive study
of the PISM parameter space for modeled ice stream-shelf systems.
