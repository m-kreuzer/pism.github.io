\<div right 45%\> \| **Grounding-line migration in plan-view marine
ice-sheet models: results of the ice2sea MISMIP3d intercomparison**
\|\| \| **investigators**: \| F. Pattyn and others, including [T.
Albrecht](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~albrecht/) and M.
Huetten\| \| **journal**: \| [Journal of
Glaciology](http://www.igsoc.org/journal/) \|

These are the results of a comparison between plan-view marine ice-sheet
models,
[MISMIP3D](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/).
The major experiments use a spatially-varying perturbation in basal
sliding parameters. The goal is to model the evolution of curved
grounding lines and the corresponding generating buttressing effects.
Steady-state grounding-line positions and the degree of reversibility
are analyzed. PISM results from PIK authors Albrecht and Huetten, on a 1
km grid using a hybrid-SSA formulation, show the same quality of steady
state positions and reversibility as models, often specially-designed
for these grounding line geometries, with more complete stress balances.
