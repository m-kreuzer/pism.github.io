A study of the extent of the Greenland ice sheet during the Mid-Pliocene
Warmth (3.3--3.0 Ma), its advance across the continental shelf during
the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene glaciations (3.0--2.4 Ma) as
implied by offshore geological studies, and the transition from glacial
to interglacial conditions around 2.4 Ma as deduced from the deposits of
the Kap KÃ¸benhavn Formation, North Greenland.
