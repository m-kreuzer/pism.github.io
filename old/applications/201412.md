Fracture processes within ice shelfs have been observed to reduce the
retentive forces of the shelves on the Antarctic ice sheet. This paper
adds a continuum representation of fractures, and their evolution, to
PISM, and applies it to several major ice shelves in Antarctica. A key
addition is the introduction of a higher-order scheme for advecting the
two-dimensional fracture density field. Fractures and ice flow are
coupled through a reduction of modeled ice viscosity proportional to the
fracture density, so fracture-induced softening can feed back to cause
added shear and self-amplified fracturing. The results of the
simulations are compared to observations. Observed sharp across-flow
velocity gradients in fracture-weakened regions are reproduced. This
fracture-softening model is a basis for a future model of enhanced
fracture-based calving.
