abstract: An ensemble of numerical simulations of the Cordilleran ice
  sheet in western North America during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
  using the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Temperature offsets to the
  present-day climatologies are applied from five different data sets.
  Surface mass balance is computed from precipitation and temperature
  using a positive degree-day model. We assess the model against a
  geomorphological reconstruction of the ice margin at the LGM.
  Modelled ice sheet outlines and volumes appear highly sensitive to
  the choice of climate forcing. For three of the four reanalysis data
  sets used, differences in precipitation are the major source for
  discrepancies between model results. Part of the mismatch is due to
  unresolved orographic precipitation effects caused by the coarse
  resolution of reanalysis data.
