Geomorphological mapping, 10Be and 26Al exposure dating and glacial
modeling are used to reconstruct the glacial history of the Shaluli
Shan, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and to understand the evolution of
the glacial landscape. The Haizishan Plateau experienced multiple ice
cap glaciations, and 10Be and 26Al exposure ages from bedrock, boulder
and saprolite profile samples show limited glacial erosion on some parts
of the plateau surface and more than 2 meters of bedrock erosion in
other areas. This juxtaposition of high erosion and relict topography
suggests that the paleo Haizishan ice cap had a complex basal thermal
regime. A numerical glacier model (PISM) is now being used to
investigate the thermal regime of the paleo ice cap and patterns of
erosion potential. This work provides new insights into the
paleoclimatic setting and glacial landscape evolution of the southeast
Tibetan Plateau.
