abstract: Fracture processes within ice shelfs have been observed to
  reduce the retentive forces of the shelves on the Antarctic ice
  sheet. This paper adds a continuum representation of fractures, and
  their evolution, to PISM, and applies it to several major ice
  shelves in Antarctica. A key addition is the introduction of a
  higher-order scheme for advecting the two-dimensional fracture
  density field. Fractures and ice flow are coupled through a
  reduction of modeled ice viscosity proportional to the fracture
  density, so fracture-induced softening can feed back to cause added
  shear and self-amplified fracturing. The results of the simulations
  are compared to observations. Observed sharp across-flow velocity
  gradients in fracture-weakened regions are reproduced. This
  fracture-softening model is a basis for a future model of enhanced
  fracture-based calving.
