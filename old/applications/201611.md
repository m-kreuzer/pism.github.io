The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) has been more stable than the other
major ice sheets for at least a million years. However, for older warm
periods there is evidence suggesting collapse of the Totten Glacier, one
of several large, ocean-forced outlets of the EAIS, with retreat into
interior basins. This paper shows that deep ice-sheet erosion has
occurred in two regions, one at the present-day head of the Glacier and
the other deep within the subglacial basin behind it. Aerogeophysical
data suggest two distinct configurations, a \"modern\" ice sheet with a
near-present-day margin, and a retreated configuration. The transitional
region between these is less eroded, suggesting shorter-lived exposure
to repeated retreat--advance events.

What is a role for PISM is such work? In this case, ice-sheet modelling
indicates that the sector\'s retreat-driven global sea-level increase
could 0.9â€‰meters in modern-like configurations, with a jump up to 2
meters or more if there is a transition to the retreated configuration.
