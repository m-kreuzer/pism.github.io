Sometimes what you need from an ice sheet model is a context for your
measurements. In this paper ice microstructure (crystal orientation,
grain size/shape), visual stratigraphy, and borehole tilt were measured
in the EDML core drilled in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica.
Microstructures reflect the dynamic conditions of the location as well
as its thermodynamic history, and determine rheological effects. PISM
was used to generate the flow field and temperatures at depth at the ice
core site from the large-scale geometry of the ice sheet and surface
inputs. The details of structural observations were evaluated using
principal strain rates from PISM, with comparison to with borehole
logging data. This comparison confirms the division of the core into
five depth regions (figure) and in turn provides a wider view of the ice
sheet.
