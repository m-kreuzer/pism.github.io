abstract: "By using MISMIP3d simulations across a range of
  resolutions, this paper shows that the SIA+SSA hybrid stress balance
  in PISM can model grounding line motion in a perturbed
  ice-sheet--shelf system. The key improvements, all included in
  pism0.6, are: linear interpolation of the grounding line,
  locally-interpolated basal friction, and an improved driving-stress
  computation across the grounding line. The reversibility of the
  grounding line, after a local perturbation of basal resistance comes
  and goes, is captured by the model even at medium and low horizontal
  resolutions (\\> 10 km). The transient model response is
  qualitatively-similar to that of higher-order models, though with
  higher sensitivity to perturbations on very short timescales. Our
  findings support the application of PISM to the Antarctic ice sheet
  from regional up to continental scales and even at relatively-low
  spatial resolutions."
