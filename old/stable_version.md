###### Latest release {#latest_release}

The current release of PISM is *v1.2*.

#### Source code {#source_code}

PISM is released as source code. To get started building PISM from
sources, we suggest using [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to
obtain the code:

`git clone `[`git://github.com/pism/pism.git`](git://github.com/pism/pism.git)` pism`

This checks out the *master* branch. Using *git* means that we can
easily distribute corrections (patches) to fix bugs.

Alternatively you can get a *.tar.gz* or *.zip* archive containing a
[tagged source code
release](https://github.com/pism/pism/releases).

See the [Installation
Manual](http://pism-docs.org/sphinx/installation/) for more
on building from source.

There is also a rapidly-evolving [development
version](development_version).
