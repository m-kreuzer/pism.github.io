Click [here](private:userslist) for a **private** list of
PISM users and their emails.

The list starts with //future// PAOTMs, if any have been prepared. The
home page shows the newest in the *applications* namespace as the
current PAOTM. On the first of the month, strip *future\_* from
*future\_applications* for the one you want by creating the
corresponding *applications* page and copying content.

From September 2011 to December 2017 we have featured one PISM
application per month, either a published article or a presented poster,
on the [home page](home). This page is now deprecated; it is
the archive.

See the [list of publications using PISM](publications) for
an up-to-date list.
