The Parallel Ice Sheet Model [[stable_version|PISM v1.2]] is open source and capable of high resolution.  It has been [[publications|widely adopted as a tool for doing science]].

Features include:
  * extensible atmospheric/ocean coupling
  * hybrid shallow stress balance
  * marine ice sheet physics
  * polythermal energy conservation
  * subglacial hydrology and till model
  * complete [[overview|documentation]]
  * parallel simulations using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface|MPI]] & [[http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/|PETSc]]
  * reads and writes [[http://cfconventions.org/|CF-compliant]] [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/|NetCDF]]

===== Team =====

PISM is jointly developed at the [[http://www.uaf.edu/|University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)]] and the [[http://www.pik-potsdam.de/|Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)]].  For more about the team see the [[about|UAF Developers]] and [[pik:pism-pik|PIK Developers]] pages.

UAF developers, who are in the [[http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/|Glaciers Group at the GI]], are supported by NASA's [[http://map.nasa.gov/|Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction]] and [[http://ice.nasa.gov/|Cryospheric Sciences]] Programs (grants NAG5-11371, NNX09AJ38C, NNX13AM16G, NNX16AQ40G, NNX17AG65G) and by NSF grants PLR-1603799 and PLR-1644277.
