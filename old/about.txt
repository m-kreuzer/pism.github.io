AKA "PISM User No. 1" which means I do my best to make all possible modeling mistakes before someone else does. When I'm not breaking PISM, I apply it to everything I can get an hand on: the Greenland ice sheet, individual drainage basins (e.g. Jakobshavn Isbrae), and even Storglaci√§ren, the famous valley glacier in northern Sweden.

I like water, especially in its frozen and liquid states. If I can have both together, even better. Thus one of my areas of interest are polythermal glaciers, glaciers which have both cold ice (below the pressure melting point) and temperate ice (at the melting point, contains small liquid water fraction). Once referred to as "the enthalpy guy" during a conference"...

My main research focus is on furthering our understanding the large dynamical signals from the Greenland Ice Sheet, their links to the atmosphere and the ocean. As the past is the key to the future, I'm working with [[http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/people/fahnestock|Mark Fahnestock]] and [[http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/joseph.a.macgregor|Joe MacGregor]] on interpreting radar layer stratigraphy. Also, I'm participating in the [[http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/wiki/index.php?title=InitMIP|initMIP]] and [[http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/activities/targeted/ismip6|ISMIP6]] efforts.
