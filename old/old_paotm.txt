Click [[private:userslist|here]] for a **private** list of PISM users and their emails.

The list starts with //future// PAOTMs, if any have been prepared.  The home page shows the newest in the ''applications'' namespace as the current PAOTM.  On the first of the month, strip ''future_'' from ''future_applications'' for the one you want by creating the corresponding ''applications'' page and copying content.

From September 2011 to December 2017 we have featured one PISM application per month, either a published article or a presented poster, on the [[home|home page]].  This page is now deprecated; it is the archive.

See the [[publications|list of publications using PISM]] for an up-to-date list.
