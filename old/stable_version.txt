~~NOTOC~~
====== Latest release ======

The current release of PISM is ''v1.2''.

==== Source code ====

PISM is released as source code.  To get started building PISM from sources, we suggest using [[http://git-scm.com/|Git]] to obtain the code:

<code>git clone git://github.com/pism/pism.git pism</code>

This checks out the ''master'' branch.  Using ''git'' means that we can easily distribute corrections (patches) to fix bugs.

Alternatively you can get a ''.tar.gz'' or ''.zip'' archive containing a  [[https://github.com/pism/pism/releases|tagged source code release]].

See the [[http://pism-docs.org/sphinx/installation/|Installation Manual]] for more on building from source.

There is also a rapidly-evolving [[development_version|development version]].
==== Next steps ====

  - See the [[http://pism-docs.org/sphinx/manual/|User's Manual]] which contains several worked examples.
