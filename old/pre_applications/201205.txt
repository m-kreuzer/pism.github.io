Numerical experiments are conducted on a synthetic topography with PISM, in which stress balance is connected to evolving thermodynamics and hydrology.  The sensitivity of cyclic behaviour to changes in sliding-law parameters and the climate input is studied. Multiple types of
oscillations were found, with strong variations in both amplitude and frequency.  High-frequency oscillations (period 114â€“169 years), which are shown to have a major impact on ice velocities and a small effect on the ice volume, are related to variations in the water distribution at the base. Low-frequency cycles (period 1000+ years), which have a major impact on both velocities and ice volume, are linked to changes in the thermal regime.
