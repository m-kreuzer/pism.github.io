Polythermal conditions are ubiquitous among glaciers and ice sheets.  Fortunately, temperature and liquid water fraction are functions of a single enthalpy variable: a small enthalpy change in cold ice is a change in temperature, while a small enthalpy change in temperate ice is a change in liquid water fraction.  The unified enthalpy formulation described in this paper models the mass and energy balance for the three-dimensional ice fluid, for the surface runoff layer and for the subglacial hydrology layer, together in a single energy-conserving theoretical framework.  It is implemented in PISM.  Results for the Greenland ice sheet are compared with those from a cold-ice scheme.
