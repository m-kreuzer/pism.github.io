Numerical experiments are conducted on a synthetic topography with PISM,
in which stress balance is connected to evolving thermodynamics and
hydrology. The sensitivity of cyclic behaviour to changes in sliding-law
parameters and the climate input is studied. Multiple types of
oscillations were found, with strong variations in both amplitude and
frequency. High-frequency oscillations (period 114--169 years), which
are shown to have a major impact on ice velocities and a small effect on
the ice volume, are related to variations in the water distribution at
the base. Low-frequency cycles (period 1000+ years), which have a major
impact on both velocities and ice volume, are linked to changes in the
thermal regime.
