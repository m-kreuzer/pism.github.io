###### Bug-reporting suggestions

Please see the [issues at our github
host](https://github.com/pism/pism/issues) to check if someone already
found a similar bug. You can post an issue there, and label it as a
bug, if it is new. Alternatively, send a report by e-mail to
[uaf-pism@alaska.edu](uaf-pism@alaska.edu).

Please include the following information in **all** bug-reports and
questions about particular PISM's behavior:

* the PISM version (the output of "*pismr -version*"),
* the **full** command necessary to reproduce the bug,
* the input files used by the run reproducing the bug,
* a description of what PISM does wrong.

When sending a PISM standard output snippet or a compilation log, please
attach it as a text file instead of pasting it into the message body.

It is great if you can

* remove irrelevant command-line options from the command exhibiting the bug
* find a quick run that exhibits the bug,
* reduce the size of files it requires,
* provide a definitive way of checking if the bug in question is fixed.
