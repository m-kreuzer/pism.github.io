====== Installing PISM on systems with unusual PETSc installations ======

PISM uses the CMake script ''FindPETSc.cmake'' to learn about your PETSc installation. This page describes a way to build PISM using a PETSc installation that heuristics in ''FindPETSc.cmake'' fail on.

We need to set the following CMake variables:

  * ''PETSC_FOUND''        - system has PETSc
  * ''PETSC_INCLUDES''     - the PETSc include directories
  * ''PETSC_LIBRARIES''    - Link these to use PETSc
  * ''PETSC_COMPILER''     - Compiler used by PETSc, helpful to find a compatible MPI
  * ''PETSC_DEFINITIONS''  - Compiler switches for using PETSc
  * ''PETSC_MPIEXEC''      - Executable for running MPI programs
  * ''PETSC_VERSION''      - Version string (MAJOR.MINOR.SUBMINOR)

In addition to this, setting ''PETSC_EXECUTABLE_RUNS'' to ''YES'' disables checks in ''FindPETSc.cmake''.

Below is a CMake script that can be used as a template:

<file cmake petsc_manual_config.cmake>
set (PETSC_EXECUTABLE_RUNS YES CACHE BOOL "Disable checking if this setup works" FORCE)

set (PETSC_FOUND YES CACHE BOOL "PETSc was found (manually)" FORCE)

set (PETSC_INCLUDES "EDIT THIS" CACHE STRING
  "Semicolon-delimited list of PETSc include directories" FORCE)

set (PETSC_LIBRARIES "EDIT THIS" CACHE STRING
  "Semicolon-delimited list of PETSc libraries" FORCE)

set (PETSC_COMPILER "EDIT THIS" CACHE FILEPATH
  "PETSc compiler; helpful to find a compatible MPI" FORCE)

set (PETSC_DEFINITIONS "EDIT THIS" CACHE STRING
  "PETSc definitions" FORCE)

set (PETSC_MPIEXEC "EDIT THIS" CACHE FILEPATH
  "Executable for running PETSc MPI programs" FORCE)

set (PETSC_VERSION "EDIT THIS" CACHE STRING
  "PETSc version: MAJOR.MINOR.SUBMINOR" FORCE)

mark_as_advanced (PETSC_INCLUDES PETSC_LIBRARIES
  PETSC_COMPILER PETSC_DEFINITIONS
  PETSC_MPIEXEC PETSC_EXECUTABLE_RUNS PETSC_VERSION)
</file>

====== How do I use this? ======
  - Download the script quoted above.
  - Edit to match your PETSc installation.
  - Run ''cmake -C path/to/petsc_manual_config.cmake path/to/pism-source'' in your build directory.
  - Follow the rest of PISM's [[installation|build instructions]].
