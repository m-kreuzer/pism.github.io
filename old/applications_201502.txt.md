In a [new Nature Communications
paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140929/ncomms6107/full/ncomms6107.html),
researchers at Victoria University and the University of New South Wales
describe a model study of Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the last 25
kyr using PISM with ocean-forcing inputs from the Earth system model
LOVECLIM. They show that when the ocean around Antarctica becomes more
stratified, warm water at depth melts the ice sheet faster than when the
ocean is less stratified.

The study used a large ensemble of 15 km PISM simulations in a
data-constrained mode. In the simulations that best fit a variety of
temporal and spatial observations, several episodes of accelerated
ice-sheet recession occurred, with the timing of the largest being
coincident with meltwater pulse 1A. This episode saw an abrupt rise in
global sea level, with an Antarctic contribution of nearly three meters
over just a few centuries.

and [this Science Daily news
item](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/10/141001102546.htm)
summarize the work and relate the modeled melt from 14,000 years ago to
present-day Antarctic conditions.
