====== PISM now uses Slack ======

PISM now has a [[https://www.slack.com|Slack]] workspace. You can join us via the link [[https://join.slack.com/t/uaf-pism/shared_invite/enQtODc3Njc1ODg0ODM5LThmOTEyNjEwN2I3ZTU4YTc5OGFhNGMzOWQ1ZmUzMWUwZDAyMzRlMzBhZDg1NDY5MmQ1YWFjNDU4MDZiNTk3YmE|Slack invite for PISM Help]]

We hope this will streamline our handling of user questions, and speed up our response time. Also, the more PISM users sign up, the more we will be able to help each other out.
