====== PISM at AGU 2010 ======

If you missed San Francisco in person then you can see some of the talks and posters given by PISM group members.  Here's what happened:
  * [[http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/AGU2010_PISM_Greenland_regine.pdf|Regine Hock talked about fixing PISM's surface mass balance schemes using climate model output]]
  * [[http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/cresis-searise.pdf|Andy Aschwanden described observational needs of ice sheet modeling, on behalf of the SeaRISE community]]
  * [[http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/Maxwell_AGU2010.zip|David Maxwell described a new algorithm for inverting surface velocities for basal stress]]
  * [[http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/AGU2010_dani.pdf|Dani DellaGiustina's poster is on the developing to regional model mode of PISM]]
  * [[http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/AGU2010_andy_poster_flowline.pdf|Andy Aschwanden's poster illustrates how PISM can be used for flowline modeling]]
