###### PhD opportunity in ice-ocean interaction (modeling) {#phd_opportunity_in_ice_ocean_interaction_modeling}

The [Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska
Fairbanks](http://www.gi.alaska.edu/) is seeking a PhD
student for the recently funded NSF project \"Understanding the controls
on spatial and temporal variability in ice discharge using a
Greenland-wide ice sheet model\". The overall goal of this project is to
develop novel parameterizations of ice-ocean interaction that are
suitable for large scale ice-sheet modeling. The interdisciplinary
project is co-led by [Andy Aschwanden (UAF; ice sheet
modeling)](http://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/people/aschwanden)
and [Patrick Heimbach (U Texas at Austin, ocean
modeling)](https://heimbach.wordpress.com/) and comprises two
PhD positions, one focussing on the ocean side (see separate
announcement) and the other on the ice sheet side (this posting). The
student here at UAF will implement and test parameterizations within the
framework of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) but will closely
collaborate with U Texas, including mutual visits.

We seek motivated candidates with a degree (preferably a M.Sc. or
equivalent) in geosciences, physics, mathematics, engineering or related
fields. Basic experience in numerical modeling, good oral and written
communication skills are a prerequisite.

For more information, please contact Andy Aschwanden
([aaschwanden\@alaska.edu](aaschwanden@alaska.edu)).
