====== PISM stable0.5 is released ======

See the [[:stable_version|stable version page]] to check out a copy of the PISM ''stable0.5'' source code.  If you have already checked out the prerelease version, just do '' "git pull" '' and then '' "make install" '' in your build directory.  Send email to [[help@pism-docs.org]] for help with any version of PISM.  See also [[http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/bueler-hamburg.pdf|slides introducing stable0.5]] at the European PISM workshop, Hamburg, Germany, May 2012.

Changes compared to ''stable0.4'' include

=== Most-significant changes ===
<hidden onHidden="Click to show the list..." onVisible="Click to hide">
  * Added regional modeling executable ''pismo'' and Python drainage-basin tools ''regional-tools''.
  * Added Jakobshavn outlet glacier model example.  See the {{:manual.pdf|User's Manual}}.
  * Separate documentation of climate forcing options in the new PDF {{:forcing.pdf|PISM's climate forcing components}} manual.
  * Consistent command-line options for climate forcing, based on improvements to climate forcing code and its interface.
  * Separated flow laws used in SIA and SSA code, and thus separated enhancement factors.  New command-line options (''-sia_e'', ''-ssa_e'') and configuration parameters (''sia_enhancement_factor'', ''ssa_enhancement_factor'').
  * ''-pdd_annualize'' implemented.  This is recommended for degree-day melting scheme usage.
  * Reported rates of change are computed as average rates over reporting intervals, by differencing cumulative quantities.
  * Removed the ''pgrn'' executable and the EISMINT-Greenland example.  All Greenland examples now use standard executable ''pismr''.  The documented SeaRISE-Greenland and Jakobshavn examples both use modern data, and fully-replace the old version.
  * Similarly, removed the EISMINT-Ross example and the ''pross'' executable.  Replaced by improved, modern example using ALBMAP and MEASURES data.  See the {{:manual.pdf|User's Manual}}.
  * Now using NetCDF4 so big files can be written (see [[news:first1km|this news item]]).  New output format options ''-o_format [netcdf4_parallel, pnetcdf]''.
  * Moved source code hosting and bugs/issues to [[https://github.com/pism/pism|github.com]].
  * Switched to [[http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/|PETSc 3.2]].

=== More usability improvements and changes ===
<hidden onHidden="Click to show the list..." onVisible="Click to hide">
  * Implemented ''-o_order [xyz, yxz, zyx]''; the first one is fastest.
  * Implemented ''-e_age_coupling''.
  * Sliding model option ''-topg_to_phi'' now it takes 4 numbers (no special value in the ocean).
  * Time-series flush whenever ''-extra_files'' are written.
  * Model time in output files is in seconds.
  * PISM uses time bounds, both in reporting code and code using forcing data.
  * Reporting for both scalar and spatial time-series: daily, monthly, yearly.

=== Under the hood ===
<hidden onHidden="Click to show the list..." onVisible="Click to hide">
  * Improved the ''IceFlowLaw'' class by moving physical constants out of it.
  * Improved the implementation of PISM's basal yield stress model.
  * Improved regridding code.
  * Implemented temperature-dependent conductivity and specific heat capacity of ice.
  * Added support for the Gregorian calendar.
  * PISM uses Proj4 to compute latitudes, longitudes, and cell areas.
