====== PISM v1.0 is out ======

This release has substantial changes to the code base, but users will not see many large
differences. The goal of most code changes was to improve modularity and usability, making PISM easier
to use, maintain and extend.

User-visible changes include the following.

  * New mass transport code makes it easier to "balance the books".
  * PISM's grids are no longer transposed (y,x versus x,y).
  * Adds an optimized implementation of the GPBLD flow law for the Glen n=3 case.
  * Adds von Mises calving.
  * Adds more diagnostic quantities (127 spatially-variable fields and 38 scalar variables in total).
  * Better code, better documentation, more regression and verification tests.
