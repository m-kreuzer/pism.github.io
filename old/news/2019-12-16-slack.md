###### PISM now uses Slack {#pism_now_uses_slack}

PISM now has a [Slack](https://www.slack.com) workspace. You
can join us via the link [Slack invite for PISM
Help](https://join.slack.com/t/uaf-pism/shared_invite/enQtODc3Njc1ODg0ODM5LThmOTEyNjEwN2I3ZTU4YTc5OGFhNGMzOWQ1ZmUzMWUwZDAyMzRlMzBhZDg1NDY5MmQ1YWFjNDU4MDZiNTk3YmE)

We hope this will streamline our handling of user questions, and speed
up our response time. Also, the more PISM users sign up, the more we
will be able to help each other out.
