###### Study of Juneau Ice Field in Cambridge Core news {#study_of_juneau_ice_field_in_cambridge_core_news}

A recent PISM application [Ziemen et al
(2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2016.13) is covered by
a [news
item](https://www.cambridge.org/core/news/alaska-could-lose-massive-icefield-by-2200)
in Cambridge Core news.

The 4000 square km ice field in Southeast Alaska is well-known and
accessible since its outlets are in the suburbs of the Alaska state
capital, Juneau. But climate data for the area are sparse.

Those model runs that agreed well with observations for 1971 to 2010
generated volume and area losses of more than half by 2099. While
co-author Regine Hock (UAF) is quoted as saying \"The massive icefield
that feeds Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier may be gone by 2200 if warming
trend predictions hold true,\", the authors emphasize that
spatially-distributed mass balance measurements and improved climate
projections that resolve the local temperature and precipitation
patterns are essential to solidifying these predictions.
