###### Two ice sheet modeling postdocs at University of Alaska Fairbanks

The University of Alaska Fairbanks invites applications for two
postdoctoral scholars in ice sheet modeling. The positions are based at
the [Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/), a
world-renowned institute for Arctic research. Our team in the
[glaciology group](https://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu/) is a
dynamic, international, and interdisciplinary team, and welcomes all
kinds of people who share our values of curiosity, creativity, and
initiative.

-   -   Project 1: Greenland**

The goal of this project to improve the representation of the processes
"where the ice meets the ocean" in a high-resolution whole-ice sheet
model. This is a crucial step on the way to the ultimate goal of fully
coupled high-resolution ice-ocean-atmosphere models, which are currently
not in the realm of the possible.

The project is in collabration with Drs Patrick Heimbach and Feras
Habbal at University of Texas at Austin. The successful candidate will
use the [Parallel Ice Sheet Model
(PISM)](https://pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php) and implement
frontal melt parameterizations currently being developed by Drs Heimbach
and Habbal, as well as contribute to the development. Frequent telecoms
and annual visits are an integral aspect of the project.

-   -   Project 2: Antarctic Peninsula**

The interactions between prevailing winds and mountain topography give
rise to order-of-magnitude variations in precipitation For mountain
ranges in which ice overtops the bedrock to form ice sheets these
orographically driven feedbacks between precipitation and surface
topography occur on timescales much shorter than for normal mountain
building. The Antarctic Peninsula is an archetype of these feedbacks. It
is aligned perpendicular to the prevailing winds and precipitation
ranges from as high as 10 m/yr on the wet side of the mountain range to
10 cm/yr on dry side over less than 50 km. Despite the low snowfall on
the dry side, the northern Antarctic Peninsula hosts large trunk
glaciers like Crane, Flask and Leppard. We hypothesize that the
feedbacks between orographic precipitation, ice dynamics, and
thermodynamics drive asymmetry in the topography and behavior of the ice
sheet.

This project is a collaboration with Dr Erin Pettit (Oregon State
University) and Dr Gerad Roe (University of Washington). The successful
candidate will implement an orographic precipitation module into the
Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) and conduct the proposed research with
the coupled ice dynamic-orographic precipitation model. Frequent
telecoms and annual visits are an integral aspect of the project.â€‚

-   -   Requirements:**

* PhD in Glaciology, Geophysics, Physics, Math, or related field.
* Experience in numerical modeling and scientific computation on high-performance computers.
* Experience with ice sheet modeling is required and experience with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model is an asset.
* A peer-reviewed publication record that is commensurate with experience.
* Applicants should have excellent English language skills and enjoy working in an international and interdisciplinary team.`

The positions are for a fixed term of 1.5 years with an anticipated
starting date of Spring 2020. Interested candidates should contact Dr.
Andy Aschwanden (<aaschwanden@alaska.edu>) with a CV including
information on your academic background, experience in
glaciology/modeling/programming, field experience, publication record,
and contact information of 2-3 referees (only email addresses), and any
other relevant information..

The call is open until the positions are filled.
