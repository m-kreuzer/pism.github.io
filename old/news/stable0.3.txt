====== PISM stable0.3 is released ======

PISM version ''stable0.3'' is available.  See the [[:stable_version|stable version page]] to check out a copy of the source code.  Send email to [[help@pism-docs.org]] for help with any version of PISM.

Compared to ''stable0.2'', the new version
  * uses a polythermal, enthalpy-based energy conservation scheme
  * includes improved atmosphere, surface processes and ocean model structure
  * puts all model parameters and physical constants in a configuration file which can be changed without re-compiling PISM
  * has a better {{:manual.pdf|User's Manual}}
  * comes with a command-line option {{:cheatsheet.pdf|Cheat-Sheet}}
  * has a better HTML {{http://www.pism-docs.org/doxy/html/index.html|PISM Source Code Browser}}
  * supports saving scalar, 2D and 3D diagnostics at given times during the run
  * allows climate forcing using spatially-varying "anomalies" (near-surface air temperature and precipitation)
  * includes better metadata handling
  * can be stopped and restarted without affecting results of a run
  * has more software tests (including regression tests)
  * has an automatic vertical grid extension mechanism
  * performs area and volume calculations using WGS84 datum to correct projection error
  * makes the computation of the age of the ice optional, for efficiency
  * has easier-to-extend source code
  * comes with three worked examples: [[:worked-searise-antarctica-uaf|Antarctica]], [[:worked-searise-greenland|Greenland]], [[:worked-storglaciaren|Storglaciaren]]
