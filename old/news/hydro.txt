In a [[http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/7/4705/2014/gmdd-7-4705-2014-discussion.html|Geoscientific Model Development Discussion paper]], UAF author Ed Bueler and IMAU author Ward Van Pelt describe PISM's new mass conserving subglacial hydrology models.

For the PISM user with an interest in subglacial hydrology this paper provides a detailed description of all the subglacial hydrology models available in PISM versions v0.6 and above, along with a stability analysis, verification, and an application to the Greenland ice sheet.
