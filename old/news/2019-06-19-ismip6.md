###### PISM and ISMIP6

The UAF PISM developers are currently busy getting PISM ready for
ISMIP6. We are implementing all the required parameterizations for
Greenland and we are making it easy to output fields in the requested
MKS system, use the ISMIP6 variable names and output the requested
fields with a shorthand.

Stay tuned.
