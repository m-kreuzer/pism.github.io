====== Successful merge: PISM + PISM-PIK = (much better PISM!) ======

If you are following the [[http://www.pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=development_version|development branch]] you know that much of the capability developed by [[http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/|Anders Levermann's group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)]] is now in PISM.  The former [[http://www.pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=pik:pism-pik|PISM-PIK branch of PISM stable0.2]] has merged with PISM.  This major merge means that PISM is now a joint UAF-PIK project.  Both groups are committed to supporting the new capabilities as an open, documented model.

This means //all// PISM users get a much improved marine ice sheet model, with better ice shelf calving front physics especially.

Our target for release of stable0.4 is May 2011.  It will contain the PISM-PIK improvements identified in [[http://www.pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=publications|Albrechts et al. (2011), Martin et al. (2010), and Winkelmann et al. (2010)]].
