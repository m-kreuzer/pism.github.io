| **Title** | [Grounding-line migration in plan-view marine ice-sheet models: results of the ice2sea MISMIP3d intercomparison](http://www.igsoc.org/journal/59/215/t12J129.html) |
| **Authors** | F. Pattyn and others, including [T. Albrecht](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~albrecht/) and M. Huetten |

These are the results of a comparison between plan-view marine ice-sheet models, [MISMIP3D](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/). The major experiments use a spatially-varying perturbation in basal sliding parameters. The goal is to model the evolution of curved grounding lines and the corresponding generating buttressing effects. Steady-state grounding-line positions and the degree of reversibility are analyzed. PISM results from PIK authors Albrecht and Huetten, on a 1 km grid using a hybrid-SSA formulation, show the same quality of steady state positions and reversibility as models, often specially-designed for these grounding line geometries, with more complete stress balances.
