This paper describes a conservative method using elevation classes to regrid surface mass balance fields between low-resolution GCMs and high-resolution ice sheet models. The proposed transformations are both mass and energy conserving, making them suitable for two-way coupling between climate and ice sheet models. These transformations are implemented in Glint2, a library used to couple atmosphere models with ice models.
