| **Title** | [When glacial giants roll over](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v472/n7341/full/472043a.html) |
| **Authors** | [Anders Leverman, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/) |
| **Venue** | [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/) |
| **Location** | Antarctic ice sheet |

In a short News & Views article in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/), Levermann reviews the potential for tsunami-genic iceberg calving as a phenomenon and a possible hazard. PISM-PIK Antarctic ice sheet simulations gave the frequency distribution of iceberg height and energy in discharge events per decade; see box. Iceberg discharge was computed from the vertical extent of the ice sheet and the marginal velocity distribution in a present-day equilibrium state. The results show a peak in the abundance of icebergs with a height of around 400 metres, and a distribution of energies up to several kilotonnes of TNT.
