This paper presents a dynamic equilibrium simulation of the ice sheet-shelf system on Antarctica with the Potsdam Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM-PIK) with a focus on the Ronne-Filchner and Ross ice shelf areas as well as on the whole ice-sheet system.
PISM-PIK (and now PISM) allows free movement of grounding lines and calving fronts thanks to a physically-motivated calving law based on horizontal spreading rates and an implementation of a calving-front stress boundary condition.
The results support the approach of superposition of SIA and SSA for the representation of fast motion of grounded ice.
