# About

The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is an open-source modelling framework for ice sheets and glaciers. It is parallel, thermodynamically coupled and capable of high
resolution. PISM has been [widely adopted as a tool for doing
science]({% link publications/index.md %}) for about twenty years now. The latest stable release is [`PISM v1.2.2`](https://github.com/pism/pism/releases).

PISM is jointly developed at the [University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)](http://www.uaf.edu/) and the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/). UAF developers are based in the [Glaciers Group](https://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu) at the [UAF Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu). For more about the team see the [Developer Team](/team/) page.

PISM development is supported by NASA's [Cryospheric Sciences](http://ice.nasa.gov/) Programs (grants NNH20ZDA001N-CRYO and NNH20ZDA001N-CRYO) and by NSF grants OPP-1914767, PLR-1603799 and PLR-1644277.
