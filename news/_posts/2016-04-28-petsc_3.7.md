title: PISM stable/dev and PETSc 3.7
---

PETSc 3.7 was released on April 25, 2016. We are currently working on
making PISM compatible with PETSc 3.7 and will announce it here as soon
as possible.

In the meantime, please install petsc 3.6.4 from
[here](http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/release-snapshots/petsc-3.6.4.tar.gz).
PISM version 0.7 (*stable0.7* branch) works with any PETSc 3.5.X and
higher.
