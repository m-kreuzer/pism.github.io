title: PISM at 5 years and r2000 on gna.org. But we are moving!

As of 19 October 2011 we have committed 2000 revisions to PISM in the
last five years, *for an average of about one commit message per day*.
We can thank *the generous public hosting of PISM at `gna.org`* for
this, and [subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) too.

By the way, we are at least nine committers: Brown, Bueler, Khroulev,
Shemonski, Aschwanden, Martin, Albrecht, Maxwell, Mengel. And quite a
few other bug reporters and active users, too! Thanks to all.

But despite wallowing in nostalgia we are going to move source code
hosts anyway!

The new host for PISM will be [at
github](https://github.com/pism/pism), and we will switch to
using the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) distributed version
control system for managing PISM development. This is following the
herd! However, with gna's unsigned certificate issues, and not quite
keeping up to date, *the UAF developers figure it is about
time*. We expect Git
will make improving the code easier after a bit of *relearning version
control*.

We will officially switch over `pism-dev` around November 1, but we will
continue to host stable versions 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 through `gna.org`. If
you are a PISM project member at `gna.org` you will get an invitation to
be a collaborator at the new github site. (Or you can request to be a
collaborator at the [PISM github
site](https://github.com/pism/pism).) Until that invitation
announcing the move, please continue to use the `gna.org` host for
commits, bugs, and tasks.
