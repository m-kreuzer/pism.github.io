title: "MPI-M Hamburg, Germany: open postdoc for coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet model"
---

The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) contributes to the BMBF
project "From the Last Interglacial to the Anthropocene: Modeling a
Complete Glacial Cycle" [(PalMod,
www.palmod.de)](https://www.palmod.de/), which aims at
simulating the climate from the peak of the last interglacial up to the
present using comprehensive Earth System Models. Phase II of this
project has an open position Postdoctoral Scientist (W073). The
successful candidate will be part of a local team performing and
analysing long-term transient simulations covering the last glacial and
the transition into the Holocene with an interactively coupled
atmosphere-ocean-ice sheet model. Additionally, the candidate will
contribute to the continued development of this model. The model system
consists of the MPI-Earth system model, the ice sheet model PISM, and
the solid-earth model VILMA.
