We have been notified that two PISM-supporting NASA research proposals
have been selected for funding, one in the Cryospheric Sciences program
and one in the Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction (MAP) program. Our
proposed research threads focus on the dynamics of the Greenland ice
sheet and on the exploitation of NASA remote observations as
constraints. The current MAP grant expires in the next few months, so
this news is timely. The new grants support PISM development and
application for four years, through mid-2017. They include support for
UAF researchers Ed Bueler, Andy Aschwanden, and Mark Fahnestock, and
full-time support for scientific programmer Constantine Khroulev.
