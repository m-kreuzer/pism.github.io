title: "Successful merge: PISM + PISM-PIK = (much better PISM!)"
---

If you are following the [development
branch](https://github.com/pism/pism/tree/dev) you know that much of
the capability developed by [Anders Levermann's group at the Potsdam
Institute for Climate Impact Research
(PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/) is now in PISM. The former
*PISM-PIK branch of PISM stable0.2* has merged with PISM. This major
merge means that PISM is now a joint UAF-PIK project. Both groups are
committed to supporting the new capabilities as an open, documented
model.

This means *all* PISM users get a much improved marine ice sheet
model, with better ice shelf calving front physics especially.

Our target for release of `stable0.4` is May 2011. It will contain the
PISM-PIK improvements identified in [Albrechts et al. (2011), Martin et
al. (2010), and Winkelmann et al.
(2010)](http://www.pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=publications).
