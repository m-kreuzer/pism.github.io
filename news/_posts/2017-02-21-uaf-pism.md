title: "New PISM user help email: {{ site.author.email }}"
---

The core team at UAF continues to support PISM users. The new email for
help is [{{ site.author.email }}](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}); it
replaces `help@pism-docs.org`. As before, email to this address will be
distributed to all the UAF developers, and so it will get the most
prompt response year-round.
