title: PISM at AGU 2010
---

If you missed San Francisco in person then you can see some of the talks
and posters given by PISM group members. Here's what happened.

* [Regine Hock talked about fixing PISM's surface mass balance schemes using climate model output](https://github.com/pism/uaf-iceflow/raw/gh-pages/AGU2010_PISM_Greenland_regine.pdf)
* [Andy Aschwanden described observational needs of ice sheet modeling, on behalf of the SeaRISE community](https://github.com/pism/uaf-iceflow/raw/gh-pages/cresis-searise.pdf)
* [David Maxwell described a new algorithm for inverting surface velocities for basal stress](https://github.com/pism/uaf-iceflow/raw/gh-pages/Maxwell_AGU2010.zip)
* [Dani DellaGiustina's poster is on the developing of the regional model mode of PISM](https://github.com/pism/uaf-iceflow/raw/gh-pages/AGU2010_dani.pdf)
* [Andy Aschwanden's poster illustrates how PISM can be used for flowline modeling](https://github.com/pism/uaf-iceflow/raw/gh-pages/AGU2010_andy_poster_flowline.pdf)
