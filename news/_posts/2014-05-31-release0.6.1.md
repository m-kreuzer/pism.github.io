title: PISM 0.6.1 has bug fixes
---

Only fixes and improvements that should not break existing functionality
are included in this release. We recommend updating from v0.6 unless you
have a good reason against it. Upgrade by doing "git pull" in the PISM
source tree. (Or get a new tagged ".tar.gz" or ".zip" at
[github.com/pism/pism/releases](https://github.com/pism/pism/releases).)
Then do "make install" in the build directory.

For a full list of changes since v0.6, please see

Send email to [help@pism-docs.org](help@pism-docs.org) for
help with any version of PISM.
