title: Parallel netCDF4 allows first Greenland simulation on a 1km grid

The upcoming stable 0.5 release supports parallel NetCDF4, thus avoiding
the file size limitations of netCDF3. This allows for unprecedented grid
resolutions.

Here at UAF we have performed the first Greenland 1km 100-year
simulations, run in parallel on 512 cores.
