In a [Geoscientific Model Development Discussion
paper](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/7/4705/2014/gmdd-7-4705-2014-discussion.html),
UAF author Ed Bueler and IMAU author Ward Van Pelt describe PISM's new
mass conserving subglacial hydrology models.

For the PISM user with an interest in subglacial hydrology this paper
provides a detailed description of all the subglacial hydrology models
available in PISM versions v0.6 and above, along with a stability
analysis, verification, and an application to the Greenland ice sheet.
