title: Ice plug prevents irreversible discharge from East Antarctica
---

In a [just-published Nature Climate Change
article](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2226.html),
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research authors Matthias Mengel
and Anders Levermann use PISM to define the "ice-plug" which, if
removed from the coastal ice in the Wilkes Basin of East Antarctica,
would initiate irreversible retreat of the grounded ice in that basin.
The modeled retreats, which occur on a time scale of a few thousand
years, generate 3--4 m of sea level rise from the region surrounding
the basin. Thus this basin is a potential "tipping-point" ice sheet
configuration, in additional to the better-known West Antarctica
configurations.

For the PISM user this paper is an indication of its ability to model an
ice sheet *region* (hashed in figure) at high resolution across a
range of ice dynamics parameters and climate forcing choices.
