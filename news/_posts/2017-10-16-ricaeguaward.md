title: EGU Early Career Award for PISM-author Ricarda Winkelmann
---

Congratulations to Ricarda Winkelmann of the University of Potsdam for
receiving the EGU's Outstanding Early Career Scientists Award in
Cryospheric Sciences. Her involvement with ice sheet modeling started
with a very cold trip to Fairbanks Alaska in November 2008, leading to a
[2011 paper on the design of PISM-PIK]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) which
is one of the most-cited PISM papers. (PISM-PIK introduced new features
for marine ice sheets which were merged into PISM itself a few years
later.) The [EGU
citation](http://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/division-outstanding-ecs-award/2017/ricarda-winkelmann/)
on her work, which has mostly been on the impact of large ice masses on
global sea level change, says her papers are a "testament to her
exceptional clarity of thought and physical insight." Search
"Winkelmann" in the [publications page]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) for
many examples.
